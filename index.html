    <h2>Stuff that has happened</h2>
    
      <p>The first day in New York I only got 6 hours of sleep. Went to dv01 at around 9:00 am. Got started learning htmi and css. Htmi and css are languages that you can use to make websites look good. After we left work we went to Maneesha's work to pick her up and get Jake a suit for a party on friday.</p>
