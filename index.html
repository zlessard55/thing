      <h3>The first day in New York I only got 6 hours of sleep. Went to dv01 at around 9:00 am. Got started learning htmi and css. Htmi and css are languages that you can use to make websites look good. After we left work we went to Maneesha's work to pick her up and get Jake a suit for a party on friday.</h3>
      
      <h4>The second day in New York I got about 7 hours of sleep. We got to dv01 around 10:20 am. I started making this website while also learning new things about html and css. Had very good chicken quesodillas for lunch. At the end of the day I did some css challenges online that were very helpful. Tomorrow I would like to learn a little more about html and css then start learning javascript so I can make this website do more things.</h4>
